<b>"Thunder by Boys Like Girls Lyrics"</b><br>
<br>     
    <b>Verse 1</b><br>    
    
Today is a winding road that's taking me to places that I didn't want to go<br>
Whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa)<br>
Today in the blink of an eye<br>
I'm holding on to something and I do not know why<br>
I tried<br>
<br>
I tried to read between the lines<br>
I tried to look in your eyes<br>
I want a simple explanation<br>
For what I'm feeling inside<br>
I gotta find a way out<br>
Maybe there's a way out<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus </b><br>     
Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer<br>
Do you know you're unlike any other?<br>
You'll always be my thunder, and I said<br>
Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors<br>
I don't wanna ever love another<br>
You'll always be my thunder<br>
So bring on the rain<br>
And bring on the thunder<br>    
<br>
<b>Verse 2</b><br>     
Today is a winding road<br>
Tell me where to start and tell me something I don't know<br>
Whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa)<br>
Today I'm on my own<br>
I can't move a muscle and I can't pick up the phone<br>
I don't know (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)<br> 
<br>
And now I'm itching for the tall grass<br>
And longing for the breeze<br>
I need to step outside<br>
Just to see if I can breathe<br>
I gotta find a way out<br>
Maybe theres a way out<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus</b><br>     
Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer<br>
Do you know you're unlike any other?<br>
You'll always be my thunder, and I said<br>
Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors<br>
I don't wanna ever love another<br>
You'll always be my thunder<br>
So bring on the rain<br>
<br>
<b>Verse 3</b><br>    
Yeah I'm walking on a tightrope<br>
I'm wrapped up in vines<br>
I think we'll make it out<br>
But you just gotta give me time<br>
Strike me down with lightning<br>
Let me feel you in my veins<br>
I wanna let you know how much I feel your pain<br>
<br>
Today is a winding road that's taking me to places that I didn't want to go<br>
Whoa<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus</b><br>    
Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer<br>
Do you know you're unlike any other?<br>
You'll always be my thunder, and I said<br>
Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors<br>
I don't wanna ever love another<br>
You'll always be my thunder<br>
<br>
And I said<br>
Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer<br>
Do you know you're unlike any other?<br>
You'll always be my thunder<br>
So bring on the rain<br>
Oh baby bring on the pain<br>
And listen to the thunder<br>
