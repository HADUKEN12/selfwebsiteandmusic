Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM. </p>

I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars.

<p> My first day of the trip I can't believe I finally got

everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera and a protein bar. Just the essentianls. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
